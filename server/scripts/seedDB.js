I follow Mac stuff obsessively, reading blogs, watching keynotes, the whole nine. But at the same time, I feel ashamed of myself for buying into the uber-super-duper consumerism of it. I mean, it's consumerism ULTRA. Then, with Steve, it's this feeling that, based on everything that I've read of him, based on all of the speeches I've read of his (and I've read most, I think), it just seems to me that someone of his intelligence and sensitivity must also see the raw, unyielding consumerism that he's the King of, and I wonder, does he care? Does he ever question what he's throwing his obvious talent behind? I wonder. Anyway, he's sick and it's really sad imagining a world without Steve Jobs. I hope he gets better.

They're going to choose 10 finalists, then there will be voting by the public. The top 3 will come on the show and perform, and then a winner will be announced. 2 things about Jerry Springer that make me think there's more to the man than he gets credit for. 1. He was the mayor of Cincinnati. Then he slept with a prostitute. But he was HONEST about it, and was able to get elected a second time. 2. He was just a little baby when his parents bundled him up, and left their home in Germany to escape the Nazis.. His entire family tree was decimated. I think this colors the man.",

But before I could sing the song, we had to get Helenmae into the room. So we sang her a song. So Ivory went to go look for her, and then we sang an Ivory song. And then, finally, we sang Helenmae a song. The only real problem is that you can't really see me, and someone was playing a tamborine right near the camera, so it's really loud. Anyway! Enjoy!

Everyone’s got an opinion, no use getting up in arms about it. But MG Siegler’s post on TechCrunch was so nasty, and so high profile, that it seemed like I had to strike back. And so I have. I present to you, “I’m MG Siegler”, in which I throw his words back at him, and more. One note: The part about him blowing his boss…that’s completely made up. I really just wanted to use the rhyme “careington/arrington”. Enjoy!",

        "description": "this is a song about an android who is completely human in every way, except that his creators didn't see fit to give him a penis, or any other mode of sexual expression. As he grew older, it became more and more of a problem, until all he can think about is having sex. Ultimately, not having that outlet, he turns against his human creators, with all the years of pent up sexual frustration coming out in a fury of violence. It's a cautionary tale, to be sure. i was given a soul endowed with consciousness i can pass a turing test with flying colors it's true i'm a machine you wouldn't know unless we fell in love and go to bed i have no genitals why give me libido without the parts to back it up i know just what i crave but i am just a slave to the lust that's running through my pipes i'll rust if i don't do it tonight I feel the burn in every electric node if i don't let it out soon, i will explode i have precision coordination and i can calculate one hundred trillion processes in under a millesecond I can tear a man in two and believe me, it's crossed my mind for lack of a penis i blame all of human kind why give me libido without the parts to back it up i know just what i crave but i'm a slave to the lust that's running through my pipes i'll rust if i don't do it tonight I feel the burn in every electric node if i don't let it out soon, i will explode i wanna fuck human or truck i wanna feel flesh a burning wanna be a fucking machine instead i'm devoted to higher learning i got an itch sonofabitch if i can't find a way to scratch it if i could build a mechanical dildo maybe i could somehow attach it on you gave me everything i needed to make my way through this world but the one thing that i wanted you withheld like a jerk so now i will destroy you will all the pent up rage fed by a lustful heart that you locked inside this cage",

I was listening to the RadioLab podcast this morning (if you don't know RadioLab, you should (http://blogs.wnyc.org/radiolab/), and they had They Might Be Giants on. They Might Be Giants just released their 14th album, a kids album called \"Here Comes Science\". It's great! Anyway. During this podcast, they challenged They Might Be Giants to make a song up on the spot using the phrase, \"Quantum decoupling transition in a one-dimensional Feshbach-resonant superfluid\". Being They Might Be Giants, they did a great job. I decided to pick up where they left off though, and use today's song a day song to write the full song. The lyrics come from an abstract that Sheey DE and Radzihovsky L. wrote on the subject in Sep. of 2005. I have NO idea what any of it means. I changed only one word...leaving out \"Luttinger\", because I couldn't figure out how to say it. Yay! We study a one-dimensional gas of fermionic atoms interacting via an s-wave molecular Feshbach resonance. At low energies the system is characterized by two Josephson-coupled Luttinger liquids, corresponding to paired atomic and molecular superfluids. We show that, in contrast to higher dimensions, the system exhibits a quantum phase transition from a phase in which the two superfluids are locked together to one in which, at low energies, quantum fluctuations suppress the Feshbach resonance (Josephson) coupling, effectively decoupling the molecular and atomic superfluids. Experimental signatures of this quantum transition include the appearance of an out-of-phase gapless mode (in addition to the standard gapless in-phase mode) in the spectrum of the decoupled superfluid phase and a discontinuous change in the molecular momentum distribution function.",

I'll present you King tree queen tree Just listening to the rustling of their leaves Let's go to scary hill and build a wall of bricks line the floor with maple leaves and the roof is made of sticks These walls these walls protect us from the hill And a car goes by And something is awry Don't take the corner fast you'll end up in the ditch Station wagon families Old folks and drunk teens But up on scary hill there's some kind of witch Do you know me Yes I know you You are the reason I can't sit still I hear the rustling See my breath And I won't follow you up the hill But I'll present you king tree queen Listen to the rustling of their leaves",

        "description": "This one was written by my friend Dan! Who are all these college kids on youtube, doing crazy tricks with ping pong balls? Why dont they do something to improve their lives? Or the lives of humankind. They could bake cookies for their grandmothers, or learn to play the accordion. Or teach ballet to inner city kids, in their free time. I know what your going to say, who the fuck am I to judge anyone else, And what have I ever done, thats worth a shit? Believe it or not the person Im disappointed in the most, is myself. I sleep too late and my hygienes not that good Ive played video games since I was ten and Ive never really saved the world, I know my chances of doing something great are getting fewer, Every time I play bioshock. Ive never watched the sunset with a child, or comforted a burn victim, in ICU. I drink too much and Im so afraid of being alone and dying. My only legacy a waste of space, another masturbator. was Gandhi ever bummed about all the time he spent weaving, Or just staring at the moon. Would Miamoto Musashi have written the five rings if he played grand theft auto? Dont get me wrong, I think the pong tricks are cool, and I cant imagine How hard they are to do. Im just saying how great the world would be, if we committed to caring For each other with the same intensity That we waste our lives.",
